# KinectMixer
A Unity3D desktop application using the XBox Kinect system to test the application of full body movement based selection methods.

The goal of this project was to explore a fun method to handle an everyday situation - like choosing the right cocktail by selecting the ingredients in an unconventional manner.

KinectMixer assumes the usage of a projector showing the display on the floor. By performing the indicated motion (Swiping left/right/up/down or kicking) over an ingredient the user selects that ingredient. After choosing the alcohol, fruit and soda type, the resulting cocktail is displayed.
